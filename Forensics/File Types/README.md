#Challenge: File Types

Flag: picoCTF{f1len@m3_m@n1pul@t10n_f0r_0b2cur17y_950c4fee}

this one was very tiring and annoying, all you have to do is run the command
``` file ```
and decompress the file in whatever compression algorithm you get there for multiple times.
The last one gives you a hex text that you get from it the final flag
